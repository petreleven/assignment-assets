1). Write a function called describe_city() that accepts the name of 
  a city and its country as. The function should print a simple sentence, such as 
  Nairobi is in Kenya.



2). CREATE A FUNCTION called sum2_numbers_and_print() THAT ADDS TWO
    NUMBERS a and b and prints a sentence
    for the answer 
    eg if a was 2 and b was 3 the function
    will add the two numbers  and print
    "The answer of adding 2 and 3 is 5"
    
    eg if a was 10 and b was 10 the function
    will add the two numbers  and print
    "The answer of adding 10 and 10 is 20"
    
    HINT://The function adds then prints , it does
    not return anything
